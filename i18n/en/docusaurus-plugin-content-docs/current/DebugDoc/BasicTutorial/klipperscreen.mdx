# KlipperScreen Extended Features

## Method to Enable the Cursor in KlipperScreen

    * Open the `KlipperScreen.conf` in the printer configuration. This file is automatically generated after installing KlipperScreen. If it doesn't exist, create it yourself.
        <ImageView image={require('./img/ks/conf.png').default} size="100%" align="center" />
    * Add the following code to the top of the configuration:
    ```cfg
    [main]
    show_cursor: True
    ```
        <ImageView image={require('./img/ks/conf-1.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />
    * Save and restart to apply changes.

## Remote Connection to Other Hosts

    * Open the `KlipperScreen.conf` in the printer configuration. This file is automatically generated after installing KlipperScreen. If it doesn't exist, create it yourself.
        <ImageView image={require('./img/ks/conf.png').default} size="100%" align="center" />
    * Add the following code to the top of the configuration:
    * You can modify the printer name `VORON-300` and the IP address `192.168.6.217` of the machine you need to connect to.
    * Note that the second `[printer KlipperScreen]` is for connecting to the remote extended machine, which can be used for debugging or shutdown.
