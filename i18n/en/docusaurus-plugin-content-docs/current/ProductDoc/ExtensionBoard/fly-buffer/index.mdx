# Introduction

# Usage of LLL Buffer

    The LLL filament buffer is a device specifically designed for remote feeding of 3D printers, aimed at simplifying the loading and unloading of materials. This buffer comes equipped with two buttons for feeding and retracting material, allowing users to perform motorized feeding and retraction operations.

### Buffer Function:

    When the extruder of the 3D printer pulls in filament, if it tugs on the remote material rack, the buffer detects this action and automatically feeds out a segment of material towards the hot end. This feeding action repeats with each tug, effectively reducing the pulling force on the filament by the extruder, maintaining a stable pushing force, and thereby enhancing the consistency of print quality.

### Filament Runout Detection:

    The buffer includes a filament runout detector which, upon detecting no material in the buffer, sends a signal to pause the 3D printer. To utilize this feature, signal pins need to be connected and the 3D printer's configuration modified. However, the buffer function can be used directly without any configuration changes.

    Through these design features, the LLL filament buffer not only simplifies material handling but also improves the stability and quality of the 3D printing process.

* Please note that the functions can only be used after the material is inserted; otherwise, you can only control the motor via the buttons.
