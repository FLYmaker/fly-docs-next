# Firmware Flashing Guide

    * SB2040 PRO V3 can connect to the host computer using either RS232 or CAN connections
    * Both RS232 and CAN require the use of `XT30(2+2)-F` for connection
    * Below is the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable style

:::danger Important
* The mainboard firmware needs to be flashed with Klipper through Katapult
* If you are sure the mainboard already has Katapult flashed, there's no need for the final Katapult firmware flashing step, which is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware on the mainboard wasn't successfully flashed
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if an LED on the mainboard starts blinking, indicating that the mainboard has entered Katapult firmware

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * SB2040 PRO V3 can connect to the host computer in the following ways
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware Flashing</Button>
        * Benefits: If `Katapult` firmware is flashed, firmware updates can be done without touching the mainboard, and bus connection is supported
        * Drawbacks: May cause homing timeouts or other errors when used with `KlipperScreen`.
        * Note: If you need to use CAN, ensure the host computer supports CAN, and you need to pair it with UTOC or a mainboard with bridge firmware
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./rs232">RS232 Firmware Flashing</Button>
        * Benefits: No special software required, reliable communication, stable
        * Drawbacks: Firmware updates require manual DFU mode or double-clicking RST to enter `Katapult` for updates
        * Note: Requires G2T or UTOR for use
