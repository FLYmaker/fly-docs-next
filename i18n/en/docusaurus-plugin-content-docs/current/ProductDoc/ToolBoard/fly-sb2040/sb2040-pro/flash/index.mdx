# Firmware Flashing Instructions

    * The SB2040 PRO can connect to the host machine via CAN
    * CAN requires the use of `XT30(2+2)-F` for connection
    * Below is the style of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable

:::danger Note
* The motherboard firmware must be flashed with Klipper through Katapult
* If it is confirmed that the motherboard has already been flashed with Katapult, there is no need to perform the final Katapult firmware flashing, which is only a precaution in case the Katapult firmware was not successfully flashed
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if an LED on the motherboard starts blinking, indicating that the motherboard has entered the Katapult firmware

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * The SB2040 PRO can connect to the host machine in the following ways
    * [CAN Firmware](./can.mdx "Click to jump")
        * Benefits: If the `Katapult` firmware is flashed, firmware updates can be performed without touching the motherboard, and it supports bus connection
        * Drawbacks: Might cause homing timeout errors when used with `KlipperScreen`.
        * Tip: If you need to use CAN, ensure the host machine supports CAN and requires UTOC or a motherboard flashed with bridging firmware
