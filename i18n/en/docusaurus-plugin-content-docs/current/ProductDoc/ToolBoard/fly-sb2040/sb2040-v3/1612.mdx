# Eddy Usage

    :::info

    * Please note that it is recommended to use a separate Z limit switch for bed leveling; it is not advised to use Eddy as a Z limit switch.
    * When installing Eddy, ensure that the bottom of Eddy is at least 1-2 mm above the nozzle.
    * When calibrating Eddy's frequency, keep the coil PCB at least 5 mm away from the bed.
    * Please ensure the entire bed is at room temperature for testing, and do not turn on the bed during the test.

## Reference Configuration and Usage Instructions

    ### Bed Leveling Configuration

        ```cfg
        [probe_eddy_current fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type: ldc1612
        z_offset: 0.8
        i2c_address: 43
        i2c_mcu: SB2040
        i2c_bus: i2c1b
        x_offset: 0
        y_offset: 0
        speed:40
        lift_speed: 5
        ```

        * Please note that there is currently no external 1612 module available, so this configuration cannot be used yet.
        ```cfg
        [probe_eddy_current fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type: ldc1612
        z_offset: 0.8
        i2c_address: 42
        i2c_mcu: SB2040
        i2c_bus: i2c1b
        x_offset: 0
        y_offset: 0
        speed:40
        lift_speed: 5
        ```

    ### Temperature Compensation Configuration

        ```cfg
        [temperature_probe fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type:Generic 3950
        sensor_pin:SB2040:gpio28
        ```

### bed_mesh Configuration

    * In [bed_mesh], it is recommended to set the `horizontal_move_z` parameter to 2, so that Eddy remains as close to the platform as possible during scanning.

    ```cfg
    [bed_mesh]
    horizontal_move_z: 2
    ```
