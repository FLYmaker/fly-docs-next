    * The SB2040 V3 is pre-flashed with the Katapult firmware for CAN connection at a rate of 1M
    * The SB2040 V3 Katapult firmware for CAN connection has rates of 500K and 1M, which can be flashed by yourself if needed

# Firmware Flashing Instructions

    * The SB2040 V3 can connect to the host computer using either RS232 or CAN
    * RS232 and CAN require the use of `XT30(2+2)-F` for connection
    * Below is the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable style

:::danger Note
* Flashing the motherboard firmware requires flashing Klipper through Katapult
* If you are sure that the motherboard has already been flashed with Katapult, there is no need to flash the Katapult firmware at the end, which is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware on the motherboard did not flash successfully
* You can quickly press the reset button twice and check if an LED on the motherboard starts blinking, which indicates that the motherboard has entered the Katapult firmware

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * The SB2040 V3 can connect to the host computer in the following ways
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware Flashing</Button>
        * Benefits: If the `Katapult` firmware is flashed, firmware updates can be done without touching the motherboard, and bus connection is supported
        * Drawbacks: Might cause homing timeout errors when used with `KlipperScreen`.
        * Tip: Make sure your host computer supports CAN and needs to be paired with UTOC or a motherboard flashed with bridge firmware
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./rs232">RS232 Firmware Flashing</Button>
        * Benefits: No special software required, reliable and stable communication
        * Drawbacks: Firmware updates require manual DFU mode or double-clicking RST to enter `Katapult` to update the firmware
        * Tip: Needs to be paired with G2T or UTOR to use
