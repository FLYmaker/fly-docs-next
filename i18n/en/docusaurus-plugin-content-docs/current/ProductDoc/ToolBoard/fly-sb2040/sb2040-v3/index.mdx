# 1. Product Introduction

    FLY SB2040 V3 is a tool board launched by Guangzhou Mellow Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for the VORON Stealthburner printhead. With this tool board, you can replace the complex wiring between the mainboard and the printhead with just four wires, optimizing the layout. SB2040 is suitable for both stealthburner and afterburner, integrating CAN transceiver, RS232 transceiver, USB port, TMC2209 driver, LIS2DW accelerometer, three controllable fans, and other functionalities. This tool board is compatible with Klipper and RRF firmware.
