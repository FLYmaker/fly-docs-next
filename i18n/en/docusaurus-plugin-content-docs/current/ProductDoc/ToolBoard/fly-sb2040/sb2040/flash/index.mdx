# Firmware Flashing Instructions

    * The SB2040 can connect to the host machine via CAN
    * CAN requires the use of `XT30(2+2)-F` for connection
    * Below is the style of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable

:::danger Notice

* The motherboard firmware needs to be flashed with Klipper through Katapult
* If you are sure that the motherboard has already been flashed with Katapult, there is no need to flash the Katapult firmware at the end, it's just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware on the motherboard wasn't successfully flashed
* You can quickly press reset twice and check if an LED on the motherboard starts blinking, if it does, it means the motherboard has entered the Katapult firmware

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * The SB2040 can only connect to the host machine via CAN
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">Flash CAN Firmware</Button>
        * Benefits: If you've flashed the `Katapult` firmware, you can update the firmware without touching the motherboard, and it supports bus connection
        * Drawbacks: Might cause homing timeouts or other errors when used with `KlipperScreen`.
        * Note: If you need to use CAN, make sure your host machine supports CAN and you need to pair it with UTOC or a motherboard flashed with bridging firmware
