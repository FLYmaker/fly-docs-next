## Product Introduction

    FLY SB2040 is a nozzle tool board launched by Guangzhou Magnesium Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for the VORON Stealthburner print head. By using this tool board, it is possible to replace the complicated wiring between the mainboard and the print head with just four wires, optimizing the layout. SB2040 is suitable for 36 stepper motors and integrates a CAN transceiver, USB port, TMC2209 driver, ADXL345 accelerometer, two controllable fans, and other functionalities. This tool board is compatible with Klipper firmware.

    * Supports CAN bus connection, providing more stable data transmission, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity
    * Onboard TMC2209 driver in UART mode, suitable for extruders
    * Onboard ADXL345 accelerometer
    * Supports leveling sensors like BLTOUCH, PL08N, and integrates XY limit switches
    * Supports 12-24V voltage input 
    * MCU: Raspberry Pi rp2040, Dual core ARM Cortex-M0+@133MHz
    * Added support for switching between 4.7K resistor (for NTC thermistor) or 1K resistor (for PT1000)
    * CAN interface uses XT30 (2+2), supports 15A current, peak 30A
    * Added onboard NTC100k resistor for chamber temperature measurement
    * Added ADXL345's INT1 and INT2 connections to MCU for some users to use for leveling
    * Supports high voltage input limit
    * Comes with a 3-meter CAN connection cable to avoid signal loss due to incorrect terminal crimping
    * Supports 2/3/4 wire fans
    * Modular design, easy to disassemble Stealthburner
    * Compatible with Hartk's Stealthburner Toolhead Board (no need to replace the fan subboard)
    * Interfaces: Controllable fans * 3, RGB * 1, limit switches * 3, heater cartridge * 1, thermistor * 1
