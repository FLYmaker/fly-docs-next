# Firmware Flashing Instructions

    * Both firmware compilation and flashing require the use of a host computer.
    * SHT36 V2 can connect to the host computer via CAN.
    * CAN requires the use of `XT30(2+2)-F` for connection.
    * Below is the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable style
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/xt30.png').default} size="80%" align="left" />

:::danger Note

* The motherboard firmware needs to be flashed through Katapult to flash Klipper.
* If it is confirmed that the motherboard has been flashed with Katapult, there is no need to flash the Katapult firmware at the end, which is just in case the Katapult firmware on the motherboard did not flash successfully.
* You can quickly press the reset button twice and see if an LED on the motherboard starts to blink, indicating that the motherboard has entered the Katapult firmware.
