# Introduction

## Product Introduction

    FLY SHT36 V2 is a nozzle tool board designed by Guangzhou Mellow Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for 3D printer extruder heads. Using this tool board, you can replace the complex wiring between the mainboard and the print head with just four wires, optimizing the layout. SHT36 V2 is suitable for 36 stepper motors and integrates a CAN transceiver, USB port, TMC2209 driver, ADXL345 accelerometer, and two controllable fans among other features. This tool board is compatible with the Klipper firmware.

    * Extremely compact design, utilizing a 6-layer board
    * Supports CAN bus connection for more stable data transmission, lower latency, and more reliable connections
    * Onboard TMC2209 driver in UART mode, suitable for extruders
    * Onboard ADXL345 accelerometer
    * Supports PT100 (MAX31865)
    * Replaceable fan MOS design
    * Supports leveling sensors like BLTOUCH, PL08N, integrates XY limit switches
    * Supports 12-24V voltage input
    * MCU: STM32F072
    * Communication: CAN
    * Supports leveling sensors like BLTOUCH, PL08N, integrates XY limit switches

## New Features

    * Added support for switching between 4.7K resistor (for NTC thermistor) or 1.1K resistor (for PT1000)
    * CAN interface no longer uses MX3.0 terminal, new connector supports 15A current, peak 30A
    * Added selectable fan voltage options: 5/12/24V
    * Added onboard NTC100k resistor for chamber temperature measurement
    * Added reverse polarity protection
    * Added ADXL345 INT1 connection to MCU for some users for leveling
    * Enlarged heater cartridge port, rated current 10A
    * Added high voltage input limit
    * Changed the main controller to a domestic MCU
    * Supports magnetic encoder (as5047d), used by Klipper for motion analysis (currently not supported by Klipper)
    * Added a 1-meter CAN connection cable to avoid signal loss due to incorrect terminal crimping by users
    * Installation dimensions: hole spacing 43.84mm, M3 mounting hole diameter
    * Processor: GD32F103 (purchased before October 28, 2022), APM32F072 (purchased after October 28, 2022)
