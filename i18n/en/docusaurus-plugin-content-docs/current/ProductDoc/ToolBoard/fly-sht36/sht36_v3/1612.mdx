# Eddy Usage

    :::info

    * Please note that it is recommended to use a separate Z limit switch for bed leveling, rather than using Eddy as the Z limit switch
    * When installing Eddy, ensure that the bottom of Eddy is at least 1-2 mm above the nozzle
    * When calibrating Eddy's frequency, keep the coil PCB at least 5mm away from the hotbed
    * Please ensure that the entire hotbed is at room temperature during testing, and do not turn on the hotbed during the test

## Reference Configuration and Usage Instructions

    ### Bed Leveling Configuration

        ```cfg
        [probe_eddy_current fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type: ldc1612
        z_offset: 0.8
        i2c_address: 43
        i2c_mcu: SHT36
        i2c_bus: i2c1e
        x_offset: 0
        y_offset: 0
        speed:40
        lift_speed: 5
        ```

        * Please note that currently there is no external 1612 module available, so this configuration cannot be used at the moment
        ```cfg
        [probe_eddy_current fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type: ldc1612
        z_offset: 0.8
        i2c_address: 42
        i2c_mcu: SHT36
        i2c_bus: i2c1e
        x_offset: 0
        y_offset: 0
        speed:40
        lift_speed: 5
        ```

    ### Temperature Compensation Configuration

        ```cfg
        [temperature_probe fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type:Generic 3950
        sensor_pin:SHT36:gpio28
        ```

### Bed Mesh Configuration

    * In `[bed_mesh]`, set the `horizontal_move_z` parameter to 2, allowing Eddy to be as close to the bed as possible during scanning

    ```cfg
    [bed_mesh]
    horizontal_move_z: 2
    ```
