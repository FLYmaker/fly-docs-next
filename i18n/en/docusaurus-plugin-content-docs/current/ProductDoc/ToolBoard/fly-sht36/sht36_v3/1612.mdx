# Eddy Usage

    :::info

    * Please note that it is recommended to use a separate Z limit switch for bed leveling, not the Eddy as a Z limit switch.
    * When installing Eddy, the bottom should be at least 1-2 mm above the nozzle.
    * When calibrating Eddy frequency, ensure the coil PCB is at least 5mm away from the heat bed.
    * Please ensure the entire bed is at room temperature when testing, and do not turn on the heat bed during the test.

## Reference Configuration and Usage Instructions
   
    ### Modifying the default frequency of ldc16121612
    This method is only for sht36-v3/SB2040-v3 or SB2040-Pro-v3
    You can use the Mobaxterm tool to execute commands

    Download link: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html
    
    [For detailed usage, please refer to](/docs/ProductDoc/SBC/fly-pi-v2/ssh)


    Execute the first command and press Enter

    ```cfg
sed -i 's/LDC1612_FREQ = 12000000/LDC1612_FREQ = 40000000/g' ~/klipper/klippy/extras/ldc1612.py
    ```

    Execute the second command and press Enter
  ```cfg
grep "LDC1612_FREQ = 40000000" ~/klipper/klippy/extras/ldc1612.py
  ```
    If the replacement is successful, a line containing `LDC1612_FREQ = 40000000` will be returned. If there is no return, the replacement was not successful.
    Or use this command to check if the change was successful

```cfg
cat /home/fly/klipper/klippy/extras/ldc1612.py
```
   <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/ToolBoard/fly-sht36/sht36_v3/img/ldc161240mhz.webp').default} size="30%" align="left" />

   Friendly reminder: After modification, please restart the Klipper service and recalibrate Eddy frequency using this command:
   ```cfg
   systemctl restart klipper
   ```
   Eddy frequency calibration command:
   ```cfg
   PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
   ```


    ### Bed Leveling Configuration

        ```cfg
        [probe_eddy_current fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type: ldc1612
        z_offset: 0.8
        i2c_address: 43
        i2c_mcu: SHT36
        i2c_bus: i2c1e
        x_offset: 0
        y_offset: 0
        speed:40
        lift_speed: 5
        ```

        * Please note that there is currently no external 1612 module available, so this configuration cannot be used for now.
        ```cfg
        [probe_eddy_current fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type: ldc1612
        z_offset: 0.8
        i2c_address: 42
        i2c_mcu: SHT36
        i2c_bus: i2c1e
        x_offset: 0
        y_offset: 0
        speed:40
        lift_speed: 5
        ```

    ### Temperature Compensation Configuration

        ```cfg
        [temperature_probe fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type:Generic 3950
        sensor_pin:SHT36:gpio28
        ```

### bed_mesh Configuration

    * In [bed_mesh], it is recommended to set the `horizontal_move_z` parameter to 2 to keep Eddy as close to the platform as possible during scanning.

    ```cfg
    [bed_mesh]
    horizontal_move_z: 2
    ```
